# SDISeesaw
Seesaw algorithm for heuristic lower bounds on linear witnesses subject to various SDI constraints. 
This code was used to verify the tightness of the bound on the guessing probability subject to almost dimension and distrust constraints, 
in the paper  "Information capacity of quantum communication under natural physical assumptions".
